# TypeScript

Tabris.js 3 targets TypeScript 3.3. TypeScript is a <em>type-safe</em> dialect of JavaScript/EcmaScript and also supports <em>ES6 module syntax</em> (`import` and `export` statements) and `async`/`await`. A complete guide to TypeScript can be found at [typescriptlang.org](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html). As an IDE we can recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [tslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) extension, but there are [many suitable TypeScript IDEs](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support) out there.

## Setup

TypeScript files have to be compiled to JavaScript before execution. The compiler is installed in the project directory to `node_modules/.bin/tsc` when generating a new Tabris.js app using the `tabris init` command. (It belongs to the `devDependencies` in `package.json`.) To compile the code, simply type `npm run build`. This also happens when sideloading code via `tabris serve`, during a full app build via `tabris build` or on the build service. Alternatively, type `tabris serve -w -a` to start the compiler in watch mode for incremental compiling. That way you do not have to restart `tabris serve` after every code change.

If you want to migrate an existing Vanilla-JavaScript Tabris.js project, do the following:

Install TypeScript in your app project:
```
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

To configure the TypeScript compiler create a new file called `tsconfig.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es6",
    "outDir": "./dist/",
    "lib": [
      "es2017"
    ],
    "jsx": "react",
    "jsxFactory": "JSX.createElement",
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "alwaysStrict": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "allowJs": true,
    "sourceMap": true
  },
  "include": [
    "./src/**/*.ts",
    "./src/**/*.tsx",
    "./src/**/*.js",
    "./src/**/*.jsx"
  ]
}
```

This is the default configuration for generated TypeScript projects. It includes support for mixed JavaScript/TypeScript projects, [JSX](./JSX.md) and [decorators](./databinding/index.md). It also adds some recommended compiler options for stricter TypeScript interpretation. If you do not need any of these, a minimal `tsconfig.json` would look like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es6",
    "outDir": "./dist/",
    "lib": [
      "es2017"
    ]
  },
  "include": [
    "./src/**/*.ts"
  ]
}
```

Now edit `package.json` to let the `main` field point to the compiled app in `dist/`:

```json
{
  "main": "dist/app.js",
  ...
}
```

Also include the following in the `scripts` sections:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc -p .",
    "watch": "tsc -p . -w --preserveWatchOutput",
    "start": "tabris serve -a -w"
  }
}
```

The `build`  and `watch` scripts are called by the Tabris.js CLI to compile the code either once (`build`) or after every file change (`watch`).
The `start` script is optional and provides a shortcut (via `npm start`) for convenient code sideloading. The `-w` switch means the `watch` script is used instead of `build`, and `-a` makes the app restart after every re-compile. As a result editing and saving a TypeScript file restarts the app including the code change.

## Type Safety

In TypeScript not all APIs, not even all Tabris.js APIs, are perfectly type safe. Here are some guidelines to avoid losing type safety.

Tabris.js specific recommendations:
* Do not use the `widget.on()` method. Instead, the Listeners API, e.g. `widget.onResize(cb);`.
* Create type-aware `WidgetCollection` instances using widget constructors as selectors, e.g. `widget.children(Button).first();`.
* Be aware that while `widget.set()` and widget constructors provides auto-completion it does not prevent you from setting non-existing properties.
* Use `widget.apply()` only to set properties of the base `Widget` class, like `layoutData`. Or avoid it completely.

General TypeScript recommendations:
* Avoid `any`. An implicit `any` may occur if you do not give a type for a variable, field or parameter, and none can be inferred by assignment.
* Avoid explicit casting, Use [type guards](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-guards-and-differentiating-types) instead. Tabris.js provides some for [`ColorValue`](./types.md#colorvalue),
* When using third-party libraries you may have to <em>[manually install declaration files](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/consumption.html)</em> to be type safe.

## Interfaces

When used in TypeScript the tabris module exports the following additional interfaces:

 * [`ImageValue`](./types.md#imagevalue), a union of all types accepted as images
 * [`ColorValue`](./types.md#colorvalue), a union of all types accepted as colors
 * [`FontValue`](./types.md#fontvalue), a union of all types accepted as fonts
 * [`PercentValue`](./types.md#percentvalue), a union of all  types accepted as percentages
 * [`PercentValue`](./types.md#percentvalue), a union of all types accepted as percentages
 * [`LinearGradientValue`](./types.md#lineargradientvalue), a union of all types accepted as gradients
 * [`Selector`](./selector.md), a union of all types accepted as gradients
 * [`Bounds`](./types.md#bounds)
 * [`Transformation`](./types.md#transformation)
 * [`Dimension`](./types.md#dimension), alias for `number`
 * [`Offset`](./types.md#offset), alias for `number`
 * [`BoxDimensions`](./types.md#boxdimensions)
 * [`ImageData`](./types.md#imagedata)
 * [`AnimationOptions`](./types.md#animationoptions)
 * [`PropertyChangedEvent<TargetType, ValueType>`](./types.md#propertychangedeventtargettype-valuetype), same as `EventObject<TargetType> & { readonly value: U }`
 * Various `{TargetType}{EventName}Event` interfaces, e.g. `PickerSelectEvent`. Only for events with additional parameters.
 * [`Properties<Widget>`](./types#propertieswidget), which is the interface of the properties parameter used by the constructor and `set` method of the given widget.

## Developing with Plugins

Plugins expose APIs that aren't part of the standard JavaScript runtime, so special handling is needed to use them with TypeScript. Regardless of whether an app is built with JavaScript or TypeScript the app needs to have the [plugin integrated](./build.md#integrating-cordova-plugins). When the app is built in debug mode it will have the plugin's code integrated and will still have the developer console to allow [code side-loading](./developer-app.md#code-sideloading), logging and [debugging](./debug.md).

For JavaScript projects, global variables are only evaluated at runtime.  However, with TypeScript (or those that want code completion in a JavaScript projects) you need type declarations for each plugin.  There are three sources for declarations:

### From the plugin itself

If the plugin includes typings, the plugin can be added as a **dev** dependency in your project's `package.json`.  Because the plugin's JavaScript/TypeScript code is not being used anywhere in the project, the TypeScript compiler will not automatically include the typings.  It is necessary to explicitly include it in your project's `tsconfig.json` file, for example:

```javascript
  "include": [
    "./src/**/*.ts",
    "./src/**/*.tsx",
    "./node_modules/cordova.plugins.diagnostic/cordova.plugins.diagnostic.d.ts"
  ]
```

### From DefinelyTyped

[DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) is a repository of community-contributed typings for thousands of packages.  Several Cordova plugins have typings available, and they can be installed by adding them to your devDependencies in `package.json`.

### Generating your own

If the plugin does not provide any nor are typings available in DefinitelyTyped you will need to write your own.

The convention for adding globals to a TypeScript project is to place a `globals.d.ts` or `plugins.d.ts` file in your project's `src` folder.  Multiple plugins can have their typings declared in the same file.

If you just want to resolve the compilation warnings and don't need autocompletion, you can declare them with `any`.  For example, if the plugin provides a global `myPlugin` variable:

```typescript
declare var myPlugin: any;
```

If the plugin attaches to the global `cordova` object, e.g. `cordova.plugins.myPlugin`:

```typescript
interface CordovaPlugins {
  myPlugin: any
}
```

The globals file will automatically become part of your project and there is no need to change `tsconfig.json`.

Of course it's always better to add the definitive types (i.e. functions with all the parameters).  Note the typings need not provide any functionality beyond satisfying the method's return type.
