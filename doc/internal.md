# Internal API

## tabris.registerType

This method registers a new native type (a proxy) and publishes the constructor on the `tabris` object. If the registered type is a widget, use `tabris.registerWidget`.

Usage:

    tabris.registerType(type, members);

The parameter `type` is the type name used to create instances. Type names should begin with an upper-case character, internal types are prefixed with an underscore. The type name is available on instances in a field `type`. A constructor of this name will be created in the `tabris` object in order to enable instanceof checks, e.g. `widget instanceof tabris.MyType`. This constructor should never be used directly.

All fields on the `members` map will be inherited by the type instances (potentially overwriting members of `tabris.Proxy`), except for the following special keys. These keys will be attached to the constructor instead and change the proxy's behavior:

* `_type`: The native type to be used in the `create` operation. If missing, the `type` name will be used.
* `_supportsChildren`: Unless this is set to true, the instance will throw exceptions when attempting to append any children.
* `_properties`: A map where the keys are all names of the natively supported properties, and the values determine how the property values are handled. For properties not in the list no `set` and `get` operations will be issued.
* `_initProperties`: A map with key-value pairs that are added to any `create` operation for that type, bypassing all checks, encoding and `_setProperty` handler.
* `_events`: A map where the keys are the names of all supported native events, and the value determines how the events are handled. (See list below.) For events that are not in the map no `listen` operations are issued.

Valid values for the `_properties` map are:

* A type identifier (see below).
* A *map* with any of these entries:
    * `type`: A type identifier. Same effect as giving the type directly. If omitted, any value is accepted.
    * `set`: A function that is called instead of creating a `set` operation for this property change. The function is called with the (encoded) property value as the sole argument and the proxy as the context (`this`). It can use the `_nativeSet` method of the proxy if needed.
    * `get`: A function that is called instead of creating a `get` operation for this property. The function is called with the proxy as the context (`this`) and must return the current value of this property. It can use the `_nativeGet` method of the proxy if needed.

The type identifier determines how the property value is checked/encoded/converted before giving it to the native.

* `true`: Accepts any value. This should only be used for internal properties.
* `"boolean"`: Accepts `true` or `false`, all other values are converted as determined by the JavaScript language ("truthy"/"falsy" values).
* `"string"`:  Accepts any strings, any non-string is converted as determined by the JavaScript language (e.g. `23.0` becomes `"23"`).
* `"natural"`: Accepts any number equal or greater than zero and smaller than infinity, with any non-round number being rounded. Any other value (including `NaN`) is rejected.
* `"integer"`: Accepts any number equal or greater than -infinity and smaller than infinity, with any non-round number being rounded. Any other value (including `NaN`) is rejected.
* `"color"`: Accepts any value describing a color as outlined in the Tabris.js documentation, other values are rejected.
* `"font"`: Accepts any value describing a color as outlined in the Tabris.js documentation, other values are rejected.
* `"image"`: Accepts any value describing an image as outlined in the Tabris.js documentation, other values are rejected.
* `"layoutData"`: Accepts any object describing layoutData as outlined in the Tabris.js documentation, with invalid keys being ignored.
* `"bounds"`: Accepts any any object describing bounds as outlined in the Tabris.js documentation. Invalid values are currently not rejected or converted.
* `["choice", ["op1", "op2", ...]]` allows `"op1"`, `"op2"`, etc. Other values are rejected.
* `["choice", ["op1": "encodedOp1", ...}]` allows `"op1"` and encodes it as `"encodedOp1"`. Other values are rejected.

Rejected values will not be passed on in a `set` operation and cause a console warning to be logged.

Valid values for the `_events` map are:

* `true`: passes the name of the event to the `listen` operation without any changes.
* A *string*: will be used as the event name in the `listen` operation instead of the public event name. Incoming notify calls with that name will be translated back to the public event name.
* A *map* with any of these entries:
    * `name`: The internal event name. Same as giving the string directly (see above).
    * `alias`: An alternative event name that is publicly available. There should be no event registered under this alias. This affects only the `listen` operations, use a `trigger` function to trigger the alias event as well as the original.
    * `listen`: A function that will be called with the new listen state (`true`/`false`) as the first argument and the proxy as the context (`this`). It can use the `_nativeListen` method of the proxy if needed. The second argument is true if the listen was invoked by registering a listener using the event alias.
    * `trigger`: A function that will be called instead of proxy.trigger for this event type.

## tabris.registerWidget

Acts as wrapper for `tabris.registerType`. The API is identical, except that the `_properties`, `_events` maps are extended to add support for properties and events common to all widgets.

## tabris.Proxy

All types that represent a native object extend this type. Aside from the public methods described in the Tabris.js documentation as widget API, it has the following internal methods that may be useful:

 * `_create(properties)`: Called once to issue the `create` operation for this instance. May be overwritten to execute some additional tasks or modify the operation, but a super call should always be included in the new implementation, e.g. `this.super("_create", properties)`.
 * `_setParent(parent)`: Called when the proxy is appended to another proxy. Issues a `set` parent operation and adds the proxy to the parent's children list. May be overwritten to execute some additional tasks or to replace/reject the parent. A super call may be included in the new implementation, e.g. `this.super("_setParent", parent)`.
 * `_checkDisposed()`: Throws an exception if the proxy has been disposed. Should be called before issuing any operations using the methods listed below.
 * `_nativeListen(event, state)`: Issues a `listen` operation. May be useful for any function in a `_listen` map.
 * `_nativeSet(name, value)`: Appends a property to the next `create` or `set` operation to be issued, without any checks or encoding. May be useful for any function in a `_setProperty` map or in `_create`.
 * `_nativeGet(name)`: Issues a `get` operation and returns the result. May be useful for any function in a `_getProperty` map.
