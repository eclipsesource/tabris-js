# Introduction

Tabris.js is a mobile framework that lets you develop apps for *iOS and Android* from a *single code base* written entirely in *JavaScript* or *TypeScript* and *JSX*.
It provides access to *native widgets* and functions, delivering native performance and look & feel on each platform.

Tabris.js has been crafted with compatibility and extensibility in mind.
The framework exposes various well-known JavaScript APIs such as [Timers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout), [Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console), [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), and [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket).
You can use existing JavaScript libraries from the [npm](http://npmjs.com/) ecosystem and [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/plugins/) plug-ins to access device functions that are not accessible by Tabris.js directly.

## First Steps

You can try out Tabris.js without installing anything on your computer.

* Install the [Tabris.js Developer App](developer-app.md) on your device and browse through the included examples.
* Play with the JavaScript code of a simple Tabris.js app online in the [Tabris.js Playground](https://tabrisjs.com/playground).
* Load your edited version in the Developer App by scanning the bar code on the playground page.

To start developing a real Tabris.js app, follow the [Quick Start Guide](getting-started.md).
We also have an excellent [ebook](https://tabrisjs.com/download/) that explains how to create, deploy and test your first Tabris.js app.
