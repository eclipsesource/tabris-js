Property Types
==============

## Bounds

Widget bounds are represented as an object with the following properties:

* **left**: *number*
The horizontal offset from the parent's left edge in dip
* **top**: *number*
The vertical offset from the parent's top edge in dip
* **width**: *number*
The width of the widget in dip
* **height**: *number*
The height of the widget in dip

Example:
```javascript
var buttonWidth = button.get("bounds").width;
```

See also [Layout](Layout.md).

## Color

Colors are specified as strings using one of the following formats:

* `#xxxxxx`
* `#xxx`
* `rgb(r, g, b)` with `r`, `g` and `b` being numbers in the range 0..255.
* `rgba(r, g, b, a)` with `a` being a number in the range 0..1.
* a [color name](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#html4) from the CSS3 specification.
* `transparent` sets a fully transparent color. This is a shortcut for `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)`.
* `initial` resets the color to its (platform-dependent) default.

Examples:

```javascript
"#f00"
"#ff0000"
"#rgb(255, 0, 0)"
"#rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)"
"red"
"initial"
```

## Dimension

A positive float, or 0, representing device independent pixels.

See also [Layout](Layout.md).

## Margin

Distance to a parent's or sibling's opposing edge in one of these formats:

* [`offset`](#offset)
* [`percentage`](#percentage)
* [`Widget`](api/Widget.md)
* [`"selector"`](#selector)
* `"prev()"`
* `"percentage offset"`
* `"selector offset"`
* `"prev() offset"`
* `[Widget, offset]`
* `[percentage, offset]`
* `[selector, offset]`
* `["prev()", offset]`

See also [Layout](Layout.md).

## Font

Fonts are specified as strings using the shorthand syntax known from CSS. The font family may be omitted, in this case the default system font will be used. The value `"initial"` resets the font to its (platform-dependent) default.

Examples:

```javascript
"bold 24px"
"12px sans-serif"
"bold italic 12px sans-serif"
"initial"
```

## GestureObject

Object containing information about the currently performed gesture. See ["Touch API"](touch.md#gesture_object).

## Image

Images are specified as objects with the following properties:

* **src**: *string*
    Image path or URL. Relative paths are resolved relative to 'package.json'.
* **width**: *number (optional)*
    Image width in dip, extracted from the image file when missing.
* **height**: *number (optional)*
    Image height in dip, extracted from the image file when missing.
* **scale**: *number (optional)*
    Image scale factor - the image will be scaled down by this factor. Ignored when width or height are set.

A plain string can be used as a shorthand, e.g. `"image.jpg"` equals `{src: "image.jpg"}`.

Examples:

```javascript
"images/catseye.jpg"
{src: "images/catseye.jpg", width: 300, height: 200}
{src: "http://example.com/catseye.jpg", scale: 2}
```

## LayoutData

Used to define how a widget should be arranged within its parent. See ["Layouts"](layout.md).

## Offset

A positive or negative float, or 0, representing device independent pixels.

See also [Layout](Layout.md).

## Percentage

A string starting with a number (int) followed directly by "%". May be negative.

See also [Layout](Layout.md).

## TouchEvent

Object containing information about the currently performed gesture. See ["Touch API"](touch.md#touch_event_object).

## Transformation

Transformations are specified as an object with the following properties:

* **rotation**: *number*, default: `0`
    Clock-wise rotation in radians.
* **scaleX**: *number*, default: `1`
    Horizontal scale factor.
* **scaleY**: *number*, default: `1`
    Vertical scale factor.
* **translationX**: *number*, default: `0`
    Horizontal translation (shift) in dip.
* **translationY**: *number*, default: `0`
    Vertical translation (shift) in dip.
* **translationZ**: *number*, default: `0`
    Z-axis translation (shift) in dip. Android 5.0+ only.

Example:

```javascript
{scaleX: 2, scaleY: 2, rotation: Math.PI * 0.75}
```
This transformation will make the widget twice as big and rotate it by 135&deg;.

## Selector

Selectors are used to filter a given list of widgets. It can be function returning a boolean for a given widget.
However, more commonly a selector is a string that may either reference a widgets type (e.g. `"Button"`, `"TextView"`), or its id (`"#myButton"`, `"#myTextView"`).
