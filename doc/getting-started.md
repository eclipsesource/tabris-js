# Getting Started
Welcome to tabris.js, the framework for developing native apps in JavaScript. For getting started you should log in to https://tabrisjs.com. It provides you with documentation and integrates with the tabris.js App.

## Installing the tabris.js App
For the iOS APP you will have to send us the UDID of your iOS device ([here is how you find it](http://whatsmyudid.com/)). We will move the new iOS TestFlight Beta service shortly.

For Android you will have to join our tabris.js Beta-Channel with the Google Account used on your device. Alternatively you can [download the apk here](http://download.eclipsesource.com/tabris.js/m4a/tabris.js-app-m4a.apk) 
( The minSdkVersion for Android is 15 (Android 4.0.x) ).
For staying up to date you should use our Beta-Channel.

You can simply use [this form](https://tabrisjs.com/developer-apps) to send us the required information.

## Explore
The tabris.js developer app comes pre-configured with several examples. These examples demonstrate the power and flexibility of tabris.js.

The examples are part of the tabris.js GitHub repository and are developed entirely in JavaScript. Checkout the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eclipsesource/tabris-js/tree/master/examples).

## The Developer Console
The tabris.js developer app ships with a developer console that can be used to track log messages, warnings and errors in the running apps. The console can be slid from the right side of the screen after you have clicked on an example or app. The console provides functionality to filter messages, restart the app and much more.

After you have explored an app you may want to go back where you have selected the app. This can be achieved by pressing the **back** button on Android or the **home** button on iOS.
