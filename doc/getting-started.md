Getting Started
===============
Welcome to tabris.js, the framework for developing native apps in JavaScript. For getting started you should log in to https://tabrisjs.com. It provides you with documentation and integrates with the tabris.js App.

Installing the tabris.js App
----------------------------
For the iOS APP you will have to send us the UDID of your iOS device ([here is how you find it](http://whatsmyudid.com/)). We will move the new iOS TestFlight Beta service shortly.

For Android you will have to join our tabris.js Beta-Channel with the Google Account used on your device. Alternatively you can [download the apk here](http://download.eclipsesource.com/tabris.js/m4a/tabris.js-app-m4a.apk). For staying up to date you should use our Beta-Channel.

You can simply use [this form](https://tabrisjs.com/developer-apps) to send us the required information.

The tabris.js developer app comes pre-configured with several examples. These examples demonstrate the power and flexibility of tabris.js.

The examples are part of the tabris.js GitHub repository and are developed entirely in JavaScript. Checkout the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eclipsesource/tabris-js/tree/master/examples).


Snippets / Shared Apps
----------------------
In addition to the examples, snippets and even entire apps can be linked to the tabris.js App by **linking** them through the tabris.js website. Click the **link** button on the [snippets page](https://tabrisjs.com/examples/) to automatically add the app to your device.

From the **Apps** tab in your tabris.js App click on the app you wish to run. If an app does not appear, you can refresh the list by swiping down on Android or by switching tabs on iOS.


Creating your first app
=======================
For creating your first app simply follow our [step by step instruction](https://tabrisjs.com/documentation/your-first-app). It requires just a bit of JavaScript code and a tabris.js App installed on your device.
