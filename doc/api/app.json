Connections to hosts that are not in the list are not affected.\n\nCertificate pinning affects the following components: XHR/fetch, WebSockets and image loading. It does *not* affect WebViews.\n\nThe list of pinned certificates has to be in the form of `[{host: <string>, hash: <string>, algorithm: <RSA2048|RSA4096|ECDSA256>}, ..]`.\n\n- The `host` attribute denotes the host name (including subdomain) of the host to be pinned ([wildcards allowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record)).\n- The `hash` attribute is the base64 encoded sha256 fingerprint of the _subjectPublicKeyInfo_, prefixed with `sha256/`.\n- The `algorithm` attribute denotes the public key algorithm of the SSL certificate and can have the values `RSA2048`, `RSA4096` or `ECDSA256`. This attribute is only required on iOS.\n\nExample: `[{host: 'freegeoip.net', hash: 'sha256/+SVYjThgePRQxQ0e8bWTQDRtPYR/xBRufqyMoeaWteo=', algorithm: 'ECDSA256'}]`\n\nFor further details see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning."
