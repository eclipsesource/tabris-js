The selection start is the index of the first character where as the end is the index of the last character + 1. E.g. to select the word \"ok\" the selection would be `[0, 2]`.\n\nTo make a selection visible the `TextInput` has to be in focus. Consequently the selection is preserved when the focus is lost and regained. When the user gives the `TextInput` focus by tapping on it, the selection is changed to represent his touch position.\n\n Getting the `selection` upon user interaction (e.g. a button press) the focus would be lost and possibly the `selection` altered due to user interaction. In such a scenario it is recommended to set the [`keepFocus`](#keepFocus) property to `true`."
