That is, the image will be displayed as small as possible while covering the entire view.\n- `auto` will scale *down* the image to *fit* into the view if it is too large, but it won't scale up a smaller image.\n- `stretch` will resize the image to the actual bounds of the image view.\n- `none` will not resize the image at all. The image will be displayed in its original size."
