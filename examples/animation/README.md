# Animation Examples
The animation examples consist of three parts, each part is on a separate Tabris page.

## Easings
Animations with different easings make up this example.

## Tray
The tray example shows how to integrate a user controlled (event based) interaction with an animation. A typical usecase for this integration is a tray. You may drag it manually into place, but when you stop dragging an animation will finish the job for you and continue to move the tray into its final position. The demo uses touch events and combines them with animation start, progress and cancel.
