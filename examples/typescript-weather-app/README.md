# Typescript Weather App Example
The Typescript Weather App example showcases Tabris.js applications written in Typescript. The App downloads weather data of the specified city from [OpenWeatherMap.org](http://openweathermap.org/) and displays current conditions as well 5 days forecast.

## Install instructions
Execute `npm install` in this examples root directory to install the TypeScript compiler. Next, write `npm run build` to run the TypeScript compiler and generate the JavaScript files in `/dist/`.
To get real weather data, a (free) API key from OpenWeatherMap is required - see `src\weatherService.ts`. Without an API key example data is displayed.
